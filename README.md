# Matrix-Multiplication-in-IEEE-754

This project helps to multiply two matrices and add a coefficient matrix in a specific format using IEEE 754 on Verilog.

# Features

- Input Options:
  - You can input data through UART or directly initialize matrices with your numbers.

- Finite State Machine (FSM):
  - It uses a special method called a Finite State Machine to make it easy to adjust the code for different needs.

- Highest Value Extraction:
  - The project also finds the highest number in the resulting matrix.
